# Detached work — the plugin as an async function, the flow as observer

Some work does not fit inside a flow run, and no amount of engineering will make it.
A code-property-graph build takes six hours. A nightly scan takes two. A video
render, a training job, a migration, a third-party export: the external service
measures these in hours or days, and the flow that asked for them measures itself in
seconds.

The usual instinct is to make the plugin wait. This document is about the
alternative: the plugin **returns immediately** with the work's *state*, the flow's
process finishes normally, the external work carries on, and a later run of the same
node picks the story up where it left off. The flow becomes an **observer** of an
external process rather than its container — and when the work finally finishes, the
node routes to a different branch of the graph and the flow continues as if it had
been waiting all along.

The point worth keeping in view: **nothing in the runtime knows about any of this.**
There is no "async node", no "poll node", no job type. One plugin node type, and a
plugin that decides its own temporal shape.

---

## 1. Why waiting does not work

Three budgets bound a plugin node, and all three are the runtime protecting itself
from a plugin that hangs:

| Budget | Value | What trips it |
|---|---|---|
| **Accept** | 15s (`initRequestTimeout`) | The plugin has not replied a `jobId`. The node fails as unreachable. |
| **Idle between commands** | the node's `idle_min` (`CancelAfterIdle`), defaulting to the run's `ExecuteTimeOut` in minutes | The job sent no command for that long. The node concludes `long_time_without_command` and gives up on it. |
| **The whole run** | `Settings.ExecuteTimeOut` | The process is over, whatever it was doing. |

A plugin that blocks on a six-hour query has two bad options:

- **Block silently** → the node is concluded `long_time_without_command`, and the
  flow moves on (or fails) while the job runs on in the plugin, unwatched.
- **Block with keepalive progress** → every heartbeat is a NATS round trip, a live
  engine process is pinned open for six hours, a canvas node sits at 40% for an
  afternoon, and the run still dies at `ExecuteTimeOut`. Nothing was gained except
  the illusion of attention.

There is a third option the protocol was built for, stated in fractal-core's own
words at the accessor that serves `_registry`:

> *"A plugin's job can outlive the process that started it, so on the next run the
> plugin is handed back its own last jobId and can ask its own side how that job is
> getting on. Nothing here is per-execution — it is a node's memory."*
> — `engine/task_accessors.go`, `GetRegistry`

That is the whole pattern. The rest of this document is how to use it.

---

## 2. Three stances a plugin can take

A plugin author chooses, per action, how the action relates to time. The node on the
canvas looks the same in all three cases.

| Stance | Work takes | The job | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Synchronous** | ms–seconds | does the work, `done` | nothing — the default |
| **Streaming** | seconds–minutes | works, `progress` as it goes, honours `ctx` | [`jobstop`](jobs-and-commands.md#stopping-a-job-with-its-flow--jobstop) if it must die with the flow |
| **Detached + observed** | hours–days | reports *state*, `done` in seconds | `_registry`, a shared id, and a branch for "not yet" |

The third is this document. The same plugin can hold all three: a settings test is
synchronous, an upload streams, a CPG build is detached. **The decision is the plugin
author's, encapsulated behind an ordinary action.** A flow author draws a node and
wires its ports; they never learn which stance it took, only that one of its ports
means *not yet*.

---

## 3. The mechanism

### What the plugin knows at the accept stage

Exactly two things, and this is worth being precise about because the pattern lives
here:

```json
{ "_registry": { "jobId": "…", "reqAt": 1782773000, "doneAt": 0, "conclusion": "done" },
  "body":      { "project": "acme/api", "query": "…" } }
```

- **`body`** — the node's form input, as always.
- **`_registry`** — **the node's memory**: what the engine recorded about this call
  site's *previous* run over this same context document.

Job commands are **not** available yet. The runtime subscribes to a job's command
subjects only once it has been told the `jobId`, which is precisely what the
middleware is deciding — so there is no context read, no progress, no routing until
the job is accepted. `_registry` is the accept stage's only channel, and it is enough.

What the engine puts there (`engine/task.go`, `pluginTypeProcess`):

| Key | Written | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `jobId` | at accept | the id this node's last run accepted — **the handle** |
| `reqAt` | at accept | unix seconds when that run started |
| `doneAt` | `0` at accept, a timestamp on a clean finish | `0` means that run did not finish cleanly |
| `conclusion` | when the job ends | `done`, `failure`, `flow_stop_by_user`, `timeout`, … |

Two properties of the registry matter as much as its contents:

- **It is keyed by call site, not by node id.** A `GoTo` that mounts the same sub-flow
  twice gives each copy its own memory, so one call's handle cannot overwrite the
  other's (`registryKey`, with a test to that effect in fractal-core's
  `engine/registry_test.go`).
- **It lives in the context document.** Anything running over the *same context* — a
  resumed run, a scheduled continuation, a re-entry through a loop edge — sees it. A
  run over a *new* context starts with an empty memory, by design: it is a different
  piece of work.

### Attach, or start

```ts
/**
 * Decide, at the accept stage, whether this execution starts new work or observes
 * work a previous execution of this same node started.
 */
async function attachOrStart(ctx: JobContext, job: Job): Promise<JobContext> {
  const input = castRequestTo<QueryInput>(job.req.data); // throws ⇒ request rejected

  // What this call site left behind last time it ran.
  const prev = input._registry?.jobId as string | undefined;
  if (prev) {
    if (await joern.has(prev)) {
      // The service still holds that query — running, or finished and not yet
      // collected. Observe it; start nothing.
      return withJobIDContext(ctx, prev);
    }
    console.log(`joern: previous query ${prev} is gone; starting a new one`);
  }

  const queryId = await joern.register(input.body.project, input.body.query);
  const problem = unusableJobId(queryId);
  if (problem) {
    await joern.cancel(queryId);
    throw new Error(problem);
  }
  return withJobIDContext(ctx, queryId);
}
```

The decision is a single question — *does the service still hold the work my last run
started?* — and the answer either adopts the old id or mints a new one from a fresh
registration. Either way the job runs under **the upstream id**, which is what makes
`_registry.jobId` a handle on the external service rather than a plugin-local token.
That is the whole dependency on
[external-job-identity.md](external-job-identity.md): adopt the id once, and the
node's memory becomes durable, storage-free, and meaningful to both systems.

> **Why `has`, not `alive`.** A query that *finished* while nobody was looking must
> also be adopted — that run is the one that collects the result. The predicate is
> "the service still knows this id", not "it is still running".

### Report, route, end

```ts
const TAG_PENDING = "pending";
const TAG_READY = "ready";
const TAG_FAILED = "_exception";

/**
 * Report where the query has got to and end the job — in seconds, whatever the query
 * is doing. The flow's process finishes; the query does not.
 */
async function observe(job: Job) {
  const ctx = job.context();
  const queryId = job.jobId; // the Joern queryId, this run and every later one

  let status: Status;
  try {
    status = await joern.poll(queryId, ctx.signal);
  } catch (err) {
    await job.doneWithError(`joern: cannot read query ${queryId}: ${err}`);
    return;
  }

  if (status.failed) {
    // Fail the node *and* route: the flow's error branch still fires.
    await job.cmdNextFilter([TAG_FAILED]);
    await job.doneWithErrorData(
      status.error,
      { queryId, stage: status.stage },
      "joern",
    );
    return;
  }

  if (!status.done) {
    // The observer's normal outcome: a successful, uninformative job that says
    // "not yet" and hands the branch to whatever re-checks later.
    await job.cmdNextFilter([TAG_PENDING]);
    await job.done(
      {
        queryId,
        state: "running",
        percent: status.percent,
        stage: status.stage,
        observedAt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
      },
      "joern",
    );
    return;
  }

  // Collecting consumes the upstream query, so the next execution of this node
  // starts a fresh one instead of re-collecting this result.
  try {
    await joern.release(queryId);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(`joern: could not release ${queryId}:`, err);
  }
  await job.cmdNextFilter([TAG_READY]);
  await job.done({ queryId, state: "done", result: status.result }, "joern");
}
```

Three outcomes, three ports, declared on the action so the canvas shows them before
anything runs:

```ts
p.addAction({
  method: "cpg.query.observe",
  // No stops.middleware here, deliberately — see § 5.
  middleware: [attachOrStart],
  requestHandler: observe,
  outbound: [
    { title: "Still running", tags: [TAG_PENDING], description: "The query is not finished; re-check later" },
    { title: "Result ready", tags: [TAG_READY], description: "The result is committed to the node's scope" },
    { title: "Query failed", tags: [TAG_FAILED], description: "The query failed upstream" },
  ],
});
```

Note what each outcome does and does not do:

- **`pending`** is a **successful** job. The node did its work — it looked — and the
  flow is told, truthfully, that the answer is not in. Failing here would be a lie,
  and would route the error branch for a query that is fine.
- The committed snapshot (`state`, `percent`, `stage`, `observedAt`) lands on the
  node's scope under `joern`, so the *flow* can see progress between runs — a
  dashboard, a contract that escalates after N attempts, a human reading the context
  document.
- **`_exception`** fails the node *and* routes: the reserved tag's edge fires, so a
  handler branch you drew runs while the node is recorded as an error.
- `done` ends the job in seconds. The process concludes `done`, the proc signal says
  so, the engine writes `doneAt` — and the query keeps running.

### The shape over time

```
run #1  09:00   attachOrStart: no memory → POST /query → q-8f21c47b3d
                observe: 2% → commit {state:running} → route "pending" → done
                process ends (done).  registry: {jobId: q-8f21c47b3d, doneAt: …}
                                                    ▲
                ──── joern keeps building the CPG ──┼───────────────────────▶
                                                    │
run #2  09:30   attachOrStart: has(q-8f21c47b3d) → adopt the SAME id
                observe: 38% → commit → "pending" → done
                                                    │
run #3  15:00   attachOrStart: adopt again          │
                observe: done → commit result → release → route "ready" → done
                                                    ▼
                the flow continues down the "ready" branch, six hours later,
                with the result on its context — and no process waited for it
```

Each run costs one HTTP call and one job. Nothing is pinned open in between: no
timer, no connection, no engine state — the same economy the platform's
park-and-resume has, reached from the plugin side.

---

## 4. Closing the loop: who re-runs the node

The plugin reports state; something has to come back and look again. That is a
**graph** decision, not a plugin one, and the pattern is indifferent to which of
these the flow author chooses:

| Shape | How it re-enters | Suits |
|---|---|---|
| **Continue After** (park and resume) | the `pending` branch ends in a delay node; the backend schedules a resume over the same context | hours–days; the canonical answer |
| **A scheduled trigger** | an external schedule starts a run over the same context on a tick | fixed cadence, many nodes observed at once |
| **A loop edge + contract** | the `pending` branch leads back to the node, with a contract counting attempts in the context | short waits, bounded retries |
| **An event** | a webhook from the service resumes the parked flow directly | the service can call back |

All four work because the plugin's side is identical in each: read the memory, adopt
the handle, report, route. The flow's re-entry mechanism is described in the wiki's
[Waiting — joins and delays](https://github.com/Inflowenger/inflow-wiki/blob/main/book/02-fusion/waiting.md);
the only requirement this pattern adds is the one that makes a memory a memory:

> **Re-enter over the same context document.** `_registry` is a node's entry in that
> document's header. A resume, a scheduled continuation and a loop edge all satisfy
> this; starting a brand-new run over a new context does not, and the plugin will
> correctly start new upstream work.

A loop also needs a floor: a contract on the `pending` branch that counts attempts
and routes to an escalation after N, or a `reqAt` check in the plugin that gives up on
a query older than its own patience. An observer with no stopping rule is an infinite
flow.

---

## 5. Cancellation: detached work usually must *not* be stopped

This is where the pattern deliberately parts company with
[`jobstop`](jobs-and-commands.md#stopping-a-job-with-its-flow--jobstop).

For a streaming job, a stopped flow means the work is waste, so the job dies with it.
For detached work the opposite is true: **outliving the flow is the feature.** The
process ending is the normal case — it ends on *every* run — and a user stopping the
flow does not mean "throw away four hours of CPG construction", because the next run
reattaches to exactly that query.

So an observer action takes **no** `stops.middleware`, and its plugin sends no
upstream abort on `canceled()`. The observer job is seconds long; there is nothing to
cancel.

Three cases where you do want a stop, and what each actually asks for:

| Case | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| The *observing* job (one poll) should abort with the flow | `stops.middleware` on the action — harmless, nearly pointless |
| The *upstream work* should die when a user abandons the flow | an explicit decision: a signal handler that calls `joern.cancel(sig.jobId)` on `canceled()` — see [external-job-identity.md § 4](external-job-identity.md#4-cancellation-making-a-stop-cross-the-boundary). Add it only if an abandoned query costs money or capacity |
| The upstream work should die when *nobody will ever collect it* | not a signal at all: a TTL on the service, or a sweeper that drops queries no flow has polled since `reqAt + N` |

The third is the honest answer for most deployments, because a flow can be deleted,
re-authored or never re-run, and no signal is published for *that*.

---

## 6. Why this needs no new node type

The flow author's view of all of the above is: a node with a port marked *Still
running* and a port marked *Result ready*. That is the entire interface. Behind it the
plugin may be:

- registering and observing an external job (this document);
- doing the work itself in a detached task and reporting its own state;
- fronting a queue, where "pending" means "not yet consumed";
- fronting a human process, where "pending" means "nobody has answered".

Every one of those has the same node type, the same protocol, the same two inputs at
the accept stage and the same three ports. The runtime needed no concept of asynchrony
to make it work: it needed a node's memory (`_registry`), a way to name work that
outlives a process (the shared id), and routing from inside a job (`cmdNextFilter`).
All three already existed for other reasons.

That is the coverage argument in miniature. A platform that added an "async node"
would have one more primitive, and still not cover the human-process case without a
second one. **Here the asynchrony is in the plugin, where the knowledge is** — the
plugin author is the only party who knows whether their service answers in 3ms or 3
days, and that knowledge stays encapsulated with the code that depends on it.

---

## 7. Limits, stated plainly

**Exactly-once is not promised, and this pattern makes that visible.** A re-entry may
re-execute the action; the registry handle is what keeps it from starting a second
query, and the handle is only as good as the service's memory of that id. If Joern
forgets the query (restart, retention, a cleaner), the plugin correctly starts a new
one — and the old one may still be running somewhere. Where that is expensive, give
the service a client-supplied idempotency key derived from the input, not the jobId.

**The registry's writable half is not exposed by this SDK.** The protocol has two more
job commands — `registry/update` and `registry/get` (`models.JobCommand` in
fractal-core) — which let a job write its own entry in the node's memory: a cursor, a
phase, an upstream handle that is not the jobId. This SDK's `Job` does not surface
them today (nor does the Go SDK's), so the durable per-node state available to a
plugin is the `jobId` the engine records, plus anything the job commits into the
node's **scope** (`done(data, key)` / `cmdSetOnPath`). That is enough for this
pattern — the handle *is* the jobId — but a plugin needing richer memory should commit
it to scope deliberately and read it back with `cmdGetScope("$this.…")` **in the
handler**, not in middleware, where context reads are not yet possible.

**`doneAt` and `conclusion` describe the run, not the work.** An observer run that
said "pending" finishes cleanly: `doneAt` is set and `conclusion` is `done` even
though the real work is unfinished. Do not read them as the state of the external job
— that is what the service is for. `reqAt` is useful, though: it dates the handle,
which is how a plugin gives up on a query that has outlived its patience.

**Polling has a cost, and it is linear in re-entries.** One HTTP call per run is
cheap; a one-minute loop edge over a six-hour build is 360 runs, 360 jobs and 360 rows
in whatever records them. Match the re-entry cadence to the work: a delay node
measured in minutes, not seconds. Sub-minute observation belongs inside a single
streaming job, not in the graph.

**The result must survive the run that collected it.** The `ready` branch is the only
run that ever sees the result, so it must be committed (`done(data, key)`) rather than
merely reported — a bare `done` with no `key` commits nothing at a path, and the next
node reads an empty scope.

**A stale handle is the one failure mode to test.** Write the case where the service
has forgotten the id: the plugin must start fresh rather than report `pending` forever
against a query that no longer exists. That is why `attachOrStart` logs and falls
through rather than trusting the memory.

## 8. Checklist

- [ ] The action's ports include a **"not yet"** port, declared in `outbound`.
- [ ] The namer reads `_registry.jobId` and adopts it **only if the service still
      holds that work**; otherwise it registers new work.
- [ ] The adopted/registered id passes the identity rules (≥ 10 characters, a usable
      subject token, unique plugin-wide — see
      [external-job-identity.md § 6](external-job-identity.md#6-rules-limits-and-failure-modes)).
- [ ] "Still running" ends as **`done`**, not an error, and routes the pending tag.
- [ ] The state snapshot is **committed** to the node's scope, so the flow can see
      progress between runs.
- [ ] The completing run **commits the result** and consumes/releases the upstream
      work.
- [ ] Upstream failure routes `_exception` **and** reports the failure, with any
      partial state in `doneWithErrorData`.
- [ ] No `stops.middleware` on the observer action unless the single poll really must
      abort with the flow.
- [ ] Re-entry happens **over the same context document**, and the loop has a floor
      (attempt count, or a `reqAt` age limit).
- [ ] The stale-handle path is implemented and tested.
